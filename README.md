Final Project for Web Game Dev


# Brainstorming section
- 2-player platformer where one person tries to complete the platforming, while the other tries to stop them
  Potential names:

- Card game where you can cheat, but if you are caught, you lose.
  Potential names: "Don't get shot in vegas", 

- Remake game from 2016/2017 Highschool game dev class "pur-pals" where you try to control 2 characters (red and blue) at the same time, trying to complete platforming and meet up before time runs out
  Potential names: "Pur-Pals 2" "Pur-Pals: Remastered" "Pur-Pals: even purpler"

# Final Idea
I am going to go with the third one listed and remake my highschool game project. Here was what I had back then/main changes I will make:

Original Game:
made using gamemaker, which ran on a language similar to Java, and ran from an application. The premise for the game is that you control two characters at the same time, one with WASD, and the other with the arrow keys, and your goal is to complete platforming to make the two characters meet up. The trick to it is that there is not enough time to complete the platforming one at a time, so you must do at least some of the platforming by controlling both characters at the same time, which can get tricky. The levels I made were usually split down the middle, with both sides trying to meet in the middle. Once the two characters touched each other, it turned into a purple character (the two characters were red and blue, which is where the name 'pur-pals' came from) and brought you to the next level. One problem I quickly ran into was that it was way easier to just control one character, run past the middle, and then try to intercept the other on their side, which I solved by creating colored barriers that only one could pass, so that they both could still access the middle, without being able to access each other's side. Everything, including the sprites and backgrounds, were entirely made by me, and did not look particularly good. 

Changes I will make to the original idea:
  - obviously, it will be created using Javascript and Phaser and run in-browser.
  - When I recreate it, I want to create/edit sprites so that it doesn't look terrible
  - Redesign the levels and tutorial I made to be better and (hopefully) more fun
  - not include extras things that were added to fill rubric requirements for that class and deviate from what was laid out above
  - include ideas I have while working on the project with what I have learned about Javascript
